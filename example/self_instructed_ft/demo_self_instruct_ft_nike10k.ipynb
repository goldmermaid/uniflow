       "25                                 Yes, here are some key properties of the KL divergence:\\n\\n* Non-symmetrical: The KL divergence is not symmetric, meaning that the distance between two distributions may vary depending on the order in which they are compared.\\n* Non-negative: The KL divergence is always non-negative, with zero representing perfect agreement between the two distributions.\\n* Infinity for certain cases: If there exists an x such that p(x) > 0 and q(x) = 0, then the KL divergence becomes infinite.\\n* Relationship with mutual information: The KL divergence is closely related to mutual information, with I(X, Y) being numerically equivalent to several terms involving the KL divergence.  \n",

It measures how well a model's predicted probabilities match the true probabilities of the underlying data. The formula for cross-entropy is -E\\_x \\sim P [log(q(x))], where P is the true distribution and q(x) is the estimated distribution. This can also be expressed as the sum of the entropy of the true distribution and the KL divergence between the true and estimated distributions.
